# Advancing smart community evaluation through the Gaming-BWM-CRITIC-CPM approach: empirical insights from China

This project implements a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) framework that combines the **Best-Worst Method (BWM)**, **CRITIC** method, and **Game Theory** for indicator weight determination and fusion.
